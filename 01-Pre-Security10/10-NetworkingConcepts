## Key Concepts
- OSI & TCP/IP models for understanding data flow
- IP addressing and subnetting for network structure
- TCP vs UDP communication
- Encapsulation process
- Telnet over TCP

---

## Attacker vs Defender Perspective
- Attackers use network models and IP ranges to scan and target systems
- Defenders use the same knowledge to segment networks and monitor traffic
- Insecure protocols like Telnet expose credentials and should be avoided
