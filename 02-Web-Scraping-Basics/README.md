# Web Scraping – Learning Notes & Practice

This folder documents my step-by-step learning of web scraping using Python.

## What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites by reading the HTML source code sent by the server.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Websites send HTML text to the browser
- Browsers render HTML into visual layouts
- Scraping works on HTML, not the visual page
- HTML consists of tags (p, div, span) and attributes (class, id)
- Scraping involves finding specific tags and classes and extracting their text
- Parsers organize HTML so it can be searched programmatically

## Tools
- Python
- requests (HTTP requests)
- BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing)

## Status
Beginner – learning fundamentals using simple static websites.
