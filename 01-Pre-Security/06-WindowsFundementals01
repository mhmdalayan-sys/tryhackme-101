## What I learned
- Difference between **Windows versions** (client vs server) and why enterprises commonly use Windows.
- Basic **Windows UI + navigation**: Start menu, settings, taskbar, file explorer, search.
- Understanding **user accounts** and why standard users vs admin matters (least privilege).
- What **User Account Control (UAC)** does and why Windows asks for confirmation on admin actions.
- Windows **file system basics**:
  - Common folders like `C:\Users\`, `Desktop`, `Documents`, `Downloads`
  - File paths and extensions
- File/Folder **permissions** basics (who can read/write/modify).
- Hidden/system files and why Windows hides important OS files by default.
- Where to find important **system info** (System settings / About / basic device info).

## Key takeaway
Windows has a lot of built-in security and management concepts (accounts, privileges, UAC, permissions). Learning these fundamentals makes it easier to understand how Windows is secured and how attackers/defenders interact with it.
