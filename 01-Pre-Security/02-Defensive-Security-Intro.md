## Key concepts
- Defensive security focuses on detecting, preventing, and responding to attacks.
- SOC (Security Operations Center) monitors systems and investigates security incidents.
- SIEM tools collect, correlate, and analyze security logs from multiple sources.
- Defensive security involves defined roles such as analysts, incident responders, and engineers.

## Application
Defensive security teams use logs and alerts during incident investigation to identify malicious activity and respond quickly.

## Key takeaway
Strong defense relies on visibility, monitoring, and coordinated response rather than reacting after damage occurs.
