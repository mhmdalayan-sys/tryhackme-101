#General Purpose
It focuses on understanding Metasploit’s architecture, using msfconsole, and learning how to work with modules
and Meterpreter in a controlled lab environment.
The goal is familiarization, not blind exploitation.
----
#Key Takeaways
-Metasploit uses a modular design (exploits, payloads, auxiliary, post).
-msfconsole is the main interface to search, configure, and execute modules.
-Successful exploitation depends on correct:
   Target selection
   Payload choice
   Option configuration
-Meterpreter provides in-memory post-exploitation capabilities.
-Sessions allow handling multiple compromised targets efficiently.
----
#Pen-Tester POV
-Quickly validate vulnerable services identified during reconnaissance.
-Test exploit reliability in a safe lab environment before real engagements.
-Use Meterpreter for:
   System enumeration
   Privilege assessment
   Credential access
-Understand attacker workflows to improve report accuracy.
-Acts as a bridge between scanning tools and manual exploitation.
