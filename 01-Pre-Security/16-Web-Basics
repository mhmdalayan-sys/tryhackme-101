Web Basics – TryHackMe Learning Log
Platform: TryHackMe (THM) Category: Web Fundamentals Room: Web Basics Status: Completed ✅

📌 Summary

This repo documents my completion of the Web Basics room on TryHackMe. It covers the core concepts behind how web applications communicate using HTTP, with a security-focused mindset.

🧱 Core Topics Covered
1️⃣ Web Application Basics

Client vs Server model
Role of the browser
HTTP as the core communication protocol

2️⃣ URL Structure

Scheme, Host, Port
Path, Query String, Fragment
Security note:
Query strings often carry user input and are common attack surfaces

3️⃣ HTTP Requests

Request line: Method, Path, Version
Common methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Headers vs Body

4️⃣ HTTP Responses

Status line and status codes (200, 301, 403, 404, 500)
Response headers and body

5️⃣ Security Headers

CSP
HSTS
X-Frame-Options
X-Content-Type-Options

Purpose:

Reduce XSS, clickjacking, and information leakage

6️⃣ Practical HTTP Interaction

Sending and inspecting HTTP requests
Understanding how servers respond

🧠 Attacker POV

HTTP traffic is readable and modifiable
User input exists in URLs, headers, and bodies

🛡️ Defender POV

Enforce proper methods
Apply security headers
Minimize information disclosure

✅ Outcome

Strong foundation in web communication
Ready for Burp Suite, OWASP Top 10, and web exploitation labs
