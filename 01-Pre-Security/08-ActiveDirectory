# Active Directory (AD)
---
## 1. Core Idea (in simple words)
- Active Directory is Microsoft’s system for managing users, computers, and permissions.
- It centralizes authentication and access in Windows environments.
---
## 2. Why It Exists (🛡️Defender View)
- Manage users from one place.
- Control who can access what.
- Apply security policies across the network.
---
## 3. 🔥 Attacker POV
- AD is usually the **heart of the organization**.
- Compromising AD often means **owning the whole network**.
- One weak account can lead to full domain compromise.
---
## 4. ⚠️ Common Misconfigurations
- Users with too many privileges.
- Weak or reused passwords.
- Old or unused accounts still enabled.
- Poor monitoring of login attempts.
---
## 5. What I Would Try as an Attacker
- Enumerate domain users and groups.
- Look for accounts with elevated permissions.
- Check for weak authentication settings.
- Try lateral movement after first access.
---
## 6. 🧠 Key Takeaways
- AD is a high-value target.
- Small mistakes can have huge impact.
- Attackers don’t need zero-days — misconfigs are enough.
