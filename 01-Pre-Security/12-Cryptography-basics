# Objective

Understand the core principles of cryptography and how encryption, hashing, and keys are used to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
---
# Environment

Linux VM (VirtualBox)
Basic CLI tools (OpenSSL)
Online labs & documentation
---
# Key takeaways

Purpose and goals of cryptography (confidentiality, integrity, authentication)
Difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
Common cryptographic algorithms (AES, RSA, SHA)
Hashing vs encryption
Real-world use cases (passwords, HTTPS, certificates)
---
# Pen-tester POV

Identify weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms in use.
Detect poor key management or insecure hashing practices.
Cryptography knowledge helps assess HTTPS, authentication mechanisms, and data protection flaws during assessments.
