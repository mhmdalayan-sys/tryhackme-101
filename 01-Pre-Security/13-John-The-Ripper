#Environment

Linux VM (VirtualBox)
John the Ripper (Jumbo)
Wordlists (rockyou, custom)
hash & zip-files for testing-usage

#Key takeaways

Password cracking relies on guessing, not decryption
Weak passwords and fast hashes are easily broken
Wordlists and rules improve cracking efficiency
Offline attacks leave no immediate traces
---
#Pen-tester POV

Test real-world password strength through hash cracking
Exploit leaked or accessible hash files
Simulate attacker techniques using wordlists and rules
Identify insecure hashing algorithms
---
#Defender POV

Enforce strong and unique password policies
Use salted, slow hashing algorithms
Restrict access to stored hashes and backups
Audit credentials using cracking tools
---
#Hands-on

Cracked sample MD5 hashes using John
Performed wordlist-based attacks
Cracked password-protected ZIP files
Tested basic rule-based modifications
---
#Proof:
Local labs and self-study exercises
