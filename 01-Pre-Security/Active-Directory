- Windows Domain provides centralized management.
- Active Directory (AD) stores and manages users, computers, and groups.
- Users & computers are managed centrally instead of per machine.
- Organizational Units (OUs) are used to organize objects and apply policies.
- Group Policy Objects (GPOs) enforce security and system settings.
- Kerberos is the default authentication protocol in AD.
- Domains can be linked using trees, forests, and trusts.
